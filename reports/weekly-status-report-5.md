# Weekly Status Report 3

## Team Report

### Goals From Last Week:
* Have a base draft of algorithm for the calendar
* add functionality to import google calendar
* Make sure we can make api calls from the frontend

### Progress and Issues:
* Implemented and tested main functionality (add a Task and edit a Task, schedule a Task, and log in)
* We ran into unexpected bugs in our schedule Task Service when we were trying to connect to Google Calendar API, and similarly we ran into issues connecting the log in to firebase
* Previously mentioned issues prevented us from being able to complete the demo on time

#### Project Meeting Agenda:
* Come up with an action plan for the upcoming week:
  * Final release
  * User documentation 
  * Developer documentation
  * pull request (must be tested, commented, and code reviewed) vs pushing directly to main
  * Commented Code?

### Plans and Goals:
* Complete final implementation by the end of the day Sunday
* Complete final testing and minor bug correction by the end of the day Monday
* Complete user and developer documentation by Tuesday
