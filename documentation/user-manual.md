## Description
What does the system do and why would a user want to use it.
Get It Done is a productivity web application designed to help people to keep schedule working sessions on their calendar corresponding to larger projects of assignments. This is different to any other 

## How to install the software
If your system has prerequisites (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.), your instructions should list all of them and indicate how to install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific version requirements these prerequisites must satisfy. If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual machine, a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide clear step-by-step instructions.

## How to run the software
How to start up the system?

## How to use the software
You can assume that your user is familiar with your particular platform (e.g., use of a Web browser, desktop applications, or mobile applications). For missing functionality, your documentation should simply indicate that this functionality is work in progress.

## How to report a bug
This should include not just the mechanics (a pointer to your issue tracker), but also what information is needed. You can set up a bug-report template in your issue tracker, or you can reference a resource about how to write a good bug report. Here is an example for bug reporting guidelines.
### For each bug make a separate report
Therefore, an effective bug report will be completed for each issue.

### Details you need
* How would you describe the bug using no more than 20 words?
* Explain the problems and not your suggested solution
* Make sure your software is up-to date with the required version for the application 
* Write the precise steps to reproduce this error
    * Indicate whether you can reproduce the bug every time, occasionally, or not at all
    * Describe how you interact with the software up until the bug
    * After executing these steps describe the result, vs the expected result
* Expected and Actual result
* Severity/Priority
### For specific bugs or crash bugs
* If you are running into a crashbug, include the stack trace that you received
* Include an error code if applicable _Ex : 404, 400, 505_
